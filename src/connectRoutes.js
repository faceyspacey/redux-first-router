/** PRIMARY EXPORT - `connectRoutes(history, routeMap, options)`:
 *
 *  PURPOSE: to provide set-it-forget-it syncing of actions to the address bar and vice
 *  versa, using the pairing of action types to express-style routePaths bi-directionally.
 *
 *  EXAMPLE:
 *  with routeMap `{ FOO: '/foo/:paramName' }`,
 *
 *  pathname '/foo/bar' would become:
 *  `{ type: 'FOO', payload: { paramName: 'bar' } }`
 *
 *  AND
 *
 *  action `{ type: 'FOO', payload: { paramName: 'bar' } }`
 *  becomes: pathname '/foo/bar'
 *
 *
 *  HOW: Firstly, the middleware listens to received actions and then converts them to the
 *  pathnames it applies to the address bar (via `history.push({ pathname })`. It also formats
 *  the action to be location-aware, primarily by including a matching pathname, which the
 *  location reducer listens to, and which user reducers can also make use of.
 *
 *  However, user reducers typically only need to  be concerned with the type
 *  and payload like they are accustomed to. That's the whole purpose of this package.
 *  The idea is by matching action types to routePaths, it's set it and forget it!
 *
 *  Secondly, a history listener listens to URL changes and dispatches actions with
 *  types and payloads that match the pathname. Hurray! Browse back/next buttons now work!
 *
 *  Both the history listener and middleware are made to not get into each other's way, i.e.
 *  avoiding double dispatching and double address bar changes.
 *
 *
 *  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ON SSR: if you're wondering, `connectRoutes()` when called returns
 *  functions in a closure that provide access to variables in a private
 *  "per instance" fashion in order to be used in SSR without leaking
 *  state between SSR requests :).
 *
 *  As much as possible has been refactored out of this file into pure or
 *  near-pure utility functions.

/** SIDE EFFECTS:
 *  Client code needs a simple `push`,`back` + `next` functions because it's convenient for

 *  simulate clicking links server side--and dont do that, dispatch actions to setup state instead.
 *
 *  THE IDIOMATIC WAY: instead use https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router-link 's `<Link />`
 *  component to generate SEO friendly urls. As its `href` prop, you pass it a path, array of path
 *  segments or action, and internally it will use `connectRoutes` to change the address bar and
 *  dispatch the correct final action from middleware.
 *
 *  NOTE ON BACK FUNCTIONALITY: The better way to accomplish a back button is to use your redux state to determine
 *  the previous URL. The location reducer will also contain relevant info. But if you must,
 *  this is here for convenience and it basically simulates the user pressing the browser
 *  back button, which of course the system picks up and parses into an action.
