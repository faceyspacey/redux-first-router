// API:

// Below is the facade around both `sessionStorage` and our "history as storage" fallback.
//
// - `saveHistory` is  called every time the history entries or index changes
// - `restoreHistory` is called on startup obviously

// Essentially the idea is that if there is no `sessionStorage`, we maintain the entire
// storage object on EACH AND EVERY history entry's `state`. I.e. `history.state` on
// every page will have the `index` and `entries` array. That way when browsers disable
// cookies/sessionStorage, we can still grab the data we need off off of history state :)
//
// It's a bit crazy, but it works very well, and there's plenty of space allowed for storing
// things there to get a lot of mileage out of it. We store the minimum amount of data necessary.
//
// Firefox has the lowest limit of 640kb PER ENTRY. IE has 1mb and chrome has at least 10mb:

// HISTORY FACADE:

export const pushState = (url: string) =>

export const replaceState = (url: string) =>

  window.history.replaceState(history, null) // set on current entry

// SESSION STORAGE FACADE:

// We use `history.state.id` to pick which "session" from `sessionStorage` to use in
// the case that multiple windows containing the app are open at the same time

    historySet(state)

// HELPERS:

const initializeHistory = () => {
  const { pathname, search, hash } = window.location
  const url = pathname + search + hash
  return { n: 1, index: 0, entries: [url] } // default history on first load
}

// We must remove entries after the index in case the user opened a link to
// another site in the middle of the entries stack and then returned via the
// back button, in which case the entries are gone for good, like a `push`.
//
// NOTE: if we did this on the first entry, we would break backing out of the
// site and returning (entries would be unnecessarily removed). So this is only applied to
// "forwarding out." That leaves one hole: if you forward out from the first entry, you will
// return and have problematic entries that should NOT be there. Then because of Rudy's
// automatic back/next detection, which causes the history track to "jump" instead of "push,"
// dispatching an action for the next entry would in fact make you leave the site instead
// of push the new entry! To circumvent that, use Rudy's <Link /> component and it will
// save the `out` flag (just before linking out) that insures this is addressed:
const format = (history, api) => {
  const { entries, index, out } = history
  const ents = index > 0 || out ? entries.slice(0, index + 1) : entries
  return toEntries(api, ents, index)
}

// IE11 sometimes throws when accessing `history.state`:
//
// - https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/pull/289
// - https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/pull/230#issuecomment-193555362
//
// The issue occurs:
// A) when you refresh a page that is the only entry and never had state set on it,
// which means it wouldn't have any state to remember in the first place
//
// B) in IE11 on load in iframes, which also won't need to remember state, as iframes
// usually aren't for navigating to other sites (and back). This may just be issue A)
//
// ALSO NOTE: this would only matter when using our history state fallback, as we don't use
// `history.state` with `sessionStorage`, with one exception: `state.id`. The `id` is used for
// a single edge case: having multiple windows open (see "Session Storage Facade" above).
