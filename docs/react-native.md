# React Native

**Redux First Router** has been thought up from the ground up with React Native (and server environments) in mind. They both make use of
the [history package's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history) `createMemoryHistory`. In coordination, we are able to present you with a first-rate
developer experience when it comes to URL-handling on native. We hope you come away feeling: "this is what I've been waiting for."

> The real clincher is first class *React Navigation* integration. Read on...


## Linking

This is really where the magic of **Redux First Router** shines. Everything is supposed to be URL-based, right. So handling incoming links from *React Native's* `Linking` API should be as easy as it comes. Here's how you kick off your app from now on:

*index.js:*
```js
import { Linking } from 'react-native'
import { push } from 'redux-first-router'
import startApp from './src'

// yes, in the latest versions of React Native,
// you can call registerComponent in a promise!
Linking.getInitialURL().then(startApp)
Linking.addEventListener('url', ({ url }) => push(url))
```

*src/index.js:*
```js
import React from 'react'
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import createHistory from 'history/createMemoryHistory'
import configureStore from './configureStore'
import App from './components/App'
import config from '../config'

const env = 'development' // in a real scenario received from environment variables

export default url => {
  const delimiter = config(env).URI_PREFIX || '://'
  const initialPath = url ? `/${url.split(delimiter)[1]}` : '/'
  const history = createHistory({ initialEntries: [initialPath] })
  const store = configureStore(history) // configuring routesMap etc happens here
  const App = createApp(store)

  AppRegistry.registerComponent('MyApp', () => App)
}

const createApp = store => () =>
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
```


## Android `BackHandler`

Implementing back button handling in React Native is as easy as it comes with *Redux First Router*. It's as follows:


```js
import { BackHandler } from 'react-native'
import { back, canGoBack } from 'redux-first-router' // client-only methods come in handy here

BackHandler.addEventListener('hardwareBackPress', () => {
  if (canGoBack()) {
    back()
    return true
  }

  return false
})
```
> Visit the [client-only-api docs](./client-only-api.md) to see how to learn about `canGoBack` etc.

## First Class React Navigation Support!

> This is a rough sneak peak of what's possible. I'm almost done and this is the crown jewel of this package, and what I'm using for all my work in the coming months (June 2017). What we have is functional, but expect the docs to be completely revamped. This is just off the top of the dome for fellow journeymen:

First off, this relies on a plugin so it's not included in web builds.

**Installation:**

```
yarn add redux-first-router-navigation
```

**Boilerplate:**

https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router-navigation-boilerplate
It's messy as F***. It has all the remains of everything I tried to put this together. This is strictly for the adventurous. It will all be cleaned up by the last week of June.


**Usage:**

```js
import { connectRoutes } from 'redux-first-router'
import reduxNavigation from 'redux-first-router-navigation'

connectRoutes(routesMap, {
  navigators: reduxNavigation({
    tabs: MyTabNavigator,
    stack1: Stack1Navigator,
    stack2: Stack2Navigator
  })
})
```

This perhaps is the crowning feature of **Redux First Router**, we have a lot to share about it.

First off, all the above setup continues to be exactly how you setup your *React Navigation*-based app. However, if you've used or studied *React Navigation*,
you know that there isn't one linear history of path "entries." There in fact is a tree of them. You may have read what the *React Navigation* team had to say about this:

>A common navigation structure in iOS is to have an independent navigation stack for each tab, where all tabs can be covered by a modal. This is three layers of router: a card stack, within tabs, all within a modal stack. So unlike our experience on web apps, the navigation state of mobile apps is too complex to encode into a single URI.
https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/blob/master/docs/blog/2017-01-Introducing-React-Navigation.md#routers-for-every-platform

That was the key realization that enabled the *React Navigation* team to finally solve the *"navigation" problem* for React. However, now that it's done, we've had a **realization** of our own:

## Realization/Motivation

- Tab Navigators and Drawer Navigators have always been and still are solved problems as far as routing and URL-driven apps are concerned.
- It's the StackNavigator that poses some challenges. Why? Because its state isn't "static," but sequence-driven (i.e. its state is an array of recently visited "scenes").
- More importantly, React Navigation's technique of nesting Navigators causes more problems than it solves for serious apps. DrawerNavigator and TabNavigator are both not sequence-driven, and consequently can be handled independently in response to "either/or" state (and the actions that trigger it).
- "Disconnected" Navigators/Routers is the most flexible when it comes to Redux.
- The nesting of navigators makes the most sense for smaller apps and for novice to intermediate developers who benefit the most from a fully automated solution. For bigger projects and more advanced developers, its trival to slide to Tab 2 in response to a given state whose primary purpose is to push a scene on to a stack. For example, a `tabIndex` reducer can trivilialy know which tab to slide to by simply providing a `navKey` value in the action that pushes scenes/routes on to your StackRouter; if every tab has a different StackNavigator, each StackNavigator gets its own `navKey` value. For all such combinations you can dream of to combine different Navigators, you can come up with similarly natural solutions.
- The URL bar may not contain enough state/info to pre-fill a StackNavigator with a sequence of routes (though it can), but it doesn't have to when first entering an app in most cases.
- Therefore, you don't really need to worry about the sequences of "scenes" stored in your StackRouter when it comes to your app being URL-driven. When you do need to, say, reset a StackNavigator, you can temporarily forgo URL-driven actions and just perform a reset action against the given StackRouter.
- With disconnected Navigators, it makes it far easier to sandwitch other Views between navigators (e.g. put a background image behind a StackNavigator that itself is on top of a TabNavigator)
- It's far easier to have your Navigators talk to each other

## The Gist

> yea baby, this shit is functional!

**Installation:**

```
yarn add redux-first-router-navigation
```

**The App:**

*src/configureStore:*
```js
import { connectRoutes } from 'redux-first-router'
import reduxNavigation from 'redux-first-router-navigation'

import MyTabNavigator from './components/MyTabNavigator'
import Stack1Navigator from './components/Stack1Navigator'
import Stack2Navigator from './components/Stack2Navigator'

// ... standard configureStore stuff
connectRoutes(history, {
    FEED: { path: '/tabs/feed', navKey: 'stack1' },
    CARD: { path: '/tabs/feed/:cardId', navKey: 'stack1' },

    LATEST: { path: '/tabs/latest', navKey: 'stack2' },
    POST: { path: '/tabs/latest/:postId', navKey: 'stack2' }
  }, {
  navigators: reduxNavigation({
    tabs: MyTabNavigator,
    stack1: Stack1Navigator,
    stack2: Stack2Navigator
  })
})
// ... standard configureStore stuff

// now you can do stuff like this:
store.dispatch({ type: 'LATEST' })
Linking.addEventListener('url', ({ url }) => push(url)) // url === '/tabs/latest'
```

As you can see, "inter-navigator" communication is fully automated (i.e. by dispatching type `'LATEST'`, you're directly talking to the navigator with `navKey` "stack2"). However more importantly, within a given Navigator's component tree, it automatically tags its actions with its given `navKey` so other navigators won't respond to the action (and you can use the `navigation.navigate` method you're used to):

*src/components/Stack2Navigator.js:*
```js
import Latest from './Card'
import Post from './Post'

export const Stack = StackNavigator({
  Latest: {
    screen: Latest,
    path: 'tabs/latest', // notice the paths match what's in the routesMap
  },
  Post: {
    screen: Post,
    path: 'tabs/latest/:postId', // note: paths are no longer used for Drawer or Tab Navigators
  }
})

const Stack2Navigator = ({ stack2, dispatch }) => (
  <Stack
    navigation={addNavigationHelpers({
      navKey: 'stack2',
      dispatch,
      state: stack2
    })}
  />
)

const mapStateToProps = ({ stack2 }) => ({ stack2 })
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Stack2Navigator)
```

*src/components/Latest.js:*
```js
export default ({ posts, navigation: { dispatch } }) => {
  <View>
    {posts.map(post => (
      <Button
        onPress={() => navigate('Post', { postId: post.id })}
        title={post.title}
      />

      // is the same as:

      <Button
        onPress={() => dispatch({ type: 'POST', payload: { postId: post.id } })}
        title={post.title}
      />
    ))}
  </View>
}

const mapStateToProps = ({ posts }) => ({ posts })
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Latest)
```
and voila!

In both Buttons, an action is dispatched. Both have knowledge of what StackNavigator you're talking to. Without specifying a `navKey`, they automatically dispatch actions with the `navKey` of their parent navigator automatically tagged.

**What about the actions dispatched by default UI elements within navigators?**

Our middleware we'll handle any actions dispatched by the default navigators (such as the `back` buttons). And we'll replace the `router.getActionForState` methods on your navigators for you with ones that will respond to the typical actions **Redux First Router** dispatches. From your point of view, nothing will have changed when it comes to configuring *React Navigation* reducers. What will have changed is you now get access to the seamless *Redux First Router* API you're perhaps familiar with from web, and you have an idiomatic way to communciate between Navigators/routers, which is the primary pain-point in using *React Navigation* with Redux.

> In my opinion, *React Navigation* started out with the concept of Redux in mind, but then saved Redux users for last in terms of optimizing experience and capabilities. ***React Navigation currently works better without Redux than it does with Redux--unless you're using this :)***

That's just the beginning though. If you're reading these docs, you're an early adopter. The React Navigation section is the latest stuff here. I've got a huge update to the docs coming. Consider this a taste...Want to see something else you can do to give you an idea of the scope that's possible?

```js
<Button
  onPress={() => navigation.reset({
    index: 0,
    stealth: true, // control hidden navigators without animating to them!
    navKey: 'stack1',
    actions: [NavigationActions.navigate({ routeName: 'Card', params: { cardId: 123 } })]
  })}
  title='STEALTH RESET'
/>
```

**If you're only using paths for StackNavigators, what does the state of a TabRouter look like?**

```js
import { Tabs } from '../components/Tabs'

const initialState = Tabs.router.getStateForAction({})

export default (prev = initialState, action) => {
  let index

  if (action.stealth) {
    return prev // stealth mechanism so tabs don't slide when u dont want them to
  }

  switch (action.navKey) {
    case 'stack1':
      index = 0
      break
    case 'stack2':
      index = 1
      break
    default:
      return Tabs.router.getStateForAction(action, prev) || prev
  }

  return prev.index === index ? prev : { ...prev, index }
}
```

Yea, it's that easy to control a TabNavigator, which is why you shouldn't take on the "frameworkESQUE" potential problems that nesting your navigators comes with. If you've been using React Navigation, you know. In short, they built a system based on this premise: **we need declarative stack-driven navigators; imperative navigators no more!** But then they determined they needed to support non-Redux users too, and so they took on the whole world and the kitchen sink.

They built a system that automatically handles all the state based on dispatch actions like `navigation.navigate` so these kinds of users could easily use it. As a result, a huge undertaking with a never-ending list of "leaks" was born.

I love React Navigation, but I recommend advanced users only use it for its StackNavigator; or if you use the other 2 navigators, don't nest them. Why? Because look how easy it is to maintain state for a TabNavigator/Router! It's even easier for a drawer (i.e. binary). Don't take on all the bloat that has become React Navigation if you're a strong redux developer. Period. Do not do it to yourself.

I have far more idiomatic solutions and built-in tools that will circument 90% of the issues in their [evergrowing Github Issue tracker](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues). Again, this is just a taste. Their StackNavigator is near-flawless. They have done some amazing work. I'm in no way trying to take what they've done down a peg. I'm just sharing my experience and perspective. Again, they really REALLY wanted to build the be-all-end-all solution to navigators. To them, that included a built-in solution to Drawers and Tab Routers (for simpler apps and less experienced developers this makes a lot of sense). As a result they bit off more than they can chew. That's my assessment. They're damn close though, but there is still lots of [leaks/bugs](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues). That all said, from a marketing perspective, what they have done is great. They captured the entire React Native community. I think it will pan out in the long run for them.

Either way, as far as I'm concerned, if you disconnect your Navivators (i.e. so all your Navigators are the top level parent), you can mitigate most the issues (which you can see for yourself in [their issue tracker](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues)).

## Onward

Perhaps most importantly though using *Redux First Navigation* solves several key issues that *React Navigation* will never solve: the fact that not all your states will be Navivgator-based. You now **DON'T have to setup a Navigator** just to properly respond to a URL. For example, if you want to trigger a Modal by simply doing:

```js
const App ({ showModal }) =>
  <View>
    <RestOfApp />
    {showModal && <MyModal />}
  </View>

const mapStateToProps ({ location }) => ({
  showModal: location.type === 'MODAL'
})

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App)
```

*you can.*

In large apps the reality is there will be endless cases where you want paths associated with states that your Navigator can't represent. *React Navigation* is going to get a lot more animation power, but just imagine right now you want the screen to flip around in response to **URL-driven state** (such as from clicking a coupon ad on Facebook). It's not something *React Navigation* is made for. I.e. one-off fancy state changes. *I.e. the precise ones you may want to be URL-driven.*

So by using *Redux First Router* as your **"master routing controller"**, you're never left in the dust when it comes to URL-driven state.

This will become clearer once its documentation becomes as clear as the rest of the docs. If you want to see it in action now, [check out the boilerplate I'm working on](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router-navigation-boilerplate). It's a mess as it has the remains of everything I've tried, but if this matches your current focus, you'll be more than intrigued.


## About the Code

The way *Redux-First Router Navigation* works is quite interesting so you may want to check out its code:

https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router-navigation

That package is a plugin to this package. Its code is called solely from `src/connectRoutes.js` withinin this repo. There is exactly 3 lines in that file regarding navigation, so as to keep the web build (which doesn't need it) minimal. Look out for the 3 corresponding functions. Basically, on startup, your Navigators' routers
are patched up as the *React Navigation* docs recommends (e.g: `router.getStateForAction`).

In addition, the NavigationHelpers are patched to tag dispatched actions with a `navKey`. That code is both interesting and easy to understand.

The more complex part is how regular Redux-First Router actions are converted to "Navigation Actions" and vice versa. I.e. if a regular React Navigation action is received by the middleware, it converts it to one Redux-First Router understands. And if a Redux-First Router action is received, it converts it to one methods like `getStateForAction` can understand. This works in conjunction with how your `getStateForAction` method is overriden in the `patchNavigators.js` file.

> Understanding that code requires first understanding the code in this repo, particularly the middleware in `connectRoutes.js`.
