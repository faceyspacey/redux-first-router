In earlier versions `history` was a `peerDependency`, this is no longer the case since version 2 has its own history management tool. This means that the arguments passed to `connectRoutes`([documentation](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router/blob/master/docs/connectRoutes.md)) need to be changed from this:


```js
  const { reducer, middleware, enhancer, thunk } = connectRoutes(
    history,
    routesMap,
    options
  )
```
to this:

```js
  const { reducer, middleware, enhancer, thunk } = connectRoutes(
    routesMap, {
    ...options,
    initialEntries
  })
```

And inside of your `configureStore.js` [file](https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/redux-first-router-demo/blob/6c8238eee713ce0079aeae1ce328d305bddd0ee3/server/configureStore.js) if you are server side rendering, change this:

 ```js
  const history = createHistory({ initialEntries: [req.path] })
  const { store, thunk } = configureStore(history, preLoadedState)
```

 To this:

 ```js
  const { store, thunk } = configureStore(preLoadedState, [req.path])
```

There is also a new extra prop, know known as `bag` make sure to study it.
=======
If you're using a custom history type, you can still import `createHashHistory` or `createMemoryHistory` from either the `history` package or `rudy-history` and add to your options as `createHistory`.

**TODO**: Move below documentation to where it belongs.


There is also a new a third `bag` parameter in all route callbacks (`thunk`, `onBeforeChange` etc). It has the value `{ action, extra }` where `extra` is a new optional value to set in *options* that works much like the [`withExtraArgument`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk#injecting-a-custom-argument)
feature of `redux-thunk` or the [`context`](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers) argument of GraphQL resolvers: any required context can be passed to your route callbacks without having to tightly couple them to it. For example a configured API client, or an `addReducer` function to dynamically inject reducers used by lazy-loaded components.
